Image Processing Lab
This project is part of a beginner-friendly virtual lab designed to explore key concepts in image processing and computer vision using Python, OpenCV, and GitHub Copilot.

Objectives

•	Load and display images using OpenCV and Matplotlib
•	Apply 2D geometric transformations (rotation, scaling)
•	Simulate 3D vision concepts (camera focal length)
•	Use GitHub for version control and Copilot for coding assistance

Tools Used
•	Python
•	OpenCV
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	GitHub Copilot
•	Visual Studio Code

How to Run
1.	Clone the repository or download the ZIP
2.	Place a sample image in the images/ folder
3.	Run image_processing.py using Python
